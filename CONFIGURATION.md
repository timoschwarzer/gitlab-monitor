# Configuration

GitLab Monitor is configured with a YAML-encoded configuration file.

Your configuration overrides the default configuration, which can be here: [/src/config.default.json](./src/config.default.json)

The configuration can be loaded statically or dynamically.


## Dynamic configuration

- Start the server in dev or production mode (see [README.md](./README.md)).
- Open the application URL
- On the home page, you'll be asked to enter your configuration (basically you gitlab API endpoint and your private token)
- Once configured, to change the existing configuration, hover the bottom left corner of the viewport!


## Static configuration

To add your configuration, copy [/src/config.template.json](./src/config.template.json) file into `/public/config.json` and update value.

```json
{
  "gitlabApi": "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4",
  "privateToken": "ABCDEF1234"
}
```

Your can also use "Headless configuration" or "Environment variable configuration" ask detailed below:

### Headless configuration
If you can't access the browser directly for some reason, you can pass
your configuration YAML encoded with base64url as `rawConfig` query parameter.

### Injecting configuration when starting the container
You can also inject your configuration at runtime by setting an environment variable, `GITLAB_MONITOR_CONFIG`.

## Configuration options

Here you'll find documentation about each configration option:
