# Configuration

GitLab Monitor is configured with a YAML-encoded configuration file.
Your configuration overrides the default configuration, which can be found
[here](./src/config.default.json)

**To change the existing configuration, hover the bottom left corner of the viewport!**

```yaml
# Required
gitlabApi: https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4

# Required
privateToken: ABCDEF123456

# In hours. Projects with last activity older than this age won't be displayed.
# If set to 0, no filter will be applied
maxAge: 168

# How many projects will be fetched from GitLab.
# If set to greater than 100, then all available projects will be retrieved (in batches of 100)
fetchCount: 20

# Show only projects with recent pipelines

# Whether to show pipeline IDs or not
showPipelineIds: true

# Control how to show job names and icons
# Can be: 'icon', 'name', 'iconAndName'
showJobs: icon

# Only show job names for specific job statuses.
# Valid values are: 'created', 'pending', 'running', 'failed', 'success', 'canceled', 'skipped' or 'manual'.
# This is an example that shows job names only for jobs with a non-success status:
showJobsNameOnlyOn:
  - canceled
  - failed
  - pending
  - running
  - skipped
  - manual

# Whether to show jobs that was restarted
showRestartedJobs: true

showDurations: true

# Whether to show the user that invoked the pipeline or not
showUsers: false

# The page title, or null to hide
title: null

# Multiply all polling intervals by this amount
# (e.g. 0.5 will make gitlab-monitor poll twice as often)

# Can be: 'any', 'public', 'internal' or 'private'
projectVisibility: any

# Limit by projects that the current user is a member of

# Filter projects
# The filter is applied to the path with namespace

filter:

  # Include projects that match this RegExp
  include: .*

  # Include projects that have tags matching this RegExp
  includeTags: .*

  # don't have their own configuration

    default: null

    # Whether to show pipelines of merged branches
    showMerged: true

    # Whether to show pipelines of tags
    showTags: true

    # Minimum number of pipelines to display for this filter.

    # Hide skipped pipelines
    hideSkippedPipelines: false

    soundAlerts:
      # If either soundUrl or speechTemplate is set to a non-null value, sound alerts will be enabled.
      # speechTemplate takes precedence over soundUrl if both are set.

      # Replace null with URL to sound file.
      # IMPORTANT: Due to some browsers blocking autoplaying audio
      #            you may have to enable audio autoplay first!
      #  Firefox:  https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay
      soundUrl: null

      # Uses the SpeechSynthesis API to speak a message when a pipeline fails.
      # Supports replacing the string NAME with the name of the user who triggered a pipeline.
      # Replace null with a string like 'NAME broke the build!'.
      # You might have to enable auto autoplay or interact with the page at least once first.
      # Not compatible with all browsers! See https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_speechsynthesis
      speechTemplate: null

      # Play alert sounds for all branches matching this regex
      include: .*

      # Play alert sounds for all included branches except for branches
      # matching this regex. Set to null to exclude none.
      exclude: null

  # Specific per-project filters
  my-project/my-group":
    # see above...

# Search projects from given API route.
# Allowed values "groups" and "users"
projectScope: null

# ID or IDs to use in query with "projectScope" parameter
# For example 123 with "projectScope": "groups" would query /groups/123/projects
# Specify an array if you with to include multiple scope IDs.
projectScopeId: null
```

## Headless configuration
If you can't access the browser directly for some reason, you can pass
your configuration YAML encoded with base64url as `rawConfig` query parameter.

## Injecting configuration when starting the container
You can also inject your configuration at runtime by setting an environment variable, `GITLAB_MONITOR_CONFIG`.
