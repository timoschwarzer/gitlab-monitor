## Use & Download

### Hosted version

If you don't want to setup your own server, you can always
use the latest version of GitLab Monitor I upload here:

<https://gitlab-monitor.timoschwarzer.com/>

Don't worry, I don't save access tokens or anything else.
Additionally, this version has a manifest.json attached which
makes it easy to pin it to your Android home screen and open
it as a full screen app.
